###########################2017-06-29

Changed IP address space, since 169.254.0.0/16 is reserved for link-local IPv4 addresses

new content of /etc/network/interfaces for eth0:

iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.51.57
    netmask 255.255.0.0
    broadcast 192.168.255.255

similarly, the connecting laptop needs to be re-configured 

-go to IPv4Settings tab and 
--set Method: Manual
--setAddresses with following details
---Address 192.168.51.58
---Netmask 255.255.0.0
---Gateway 192.168.255.255

Caution: two laptops that have the same address set, cannot connect at the same time, so for your machine, replace the 58 in 192.168.51.58 with a unique address that is not 57 (delphin2).

>>> from this line
# eth0 is acksys, eth1 is wired

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0 eth1
iface eth0 inet static
    address 169.254.51.57
    network 169.254.0.0
